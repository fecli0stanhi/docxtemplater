Actuarial management is the application of actuarial science to the management of financial risks and uncertainties. The actuarial control cycle is a framework that describes the process of identifying, measuring, monitoring, and managing these risks and uncertainties. The actuarial control cycle consists of four main steps: defining the problem, designing a solution, monitoring experience, and reviewing and refining the solution. The actuarial control cycle is an iterative and dynamic process that requires constant feedback and improvement.

The actuarial control cycle is based on the following principles:
 
- Actuaries should have a clear understanding of the objectives and constraints of the problem they are trying to solve.
- Actuaries should use appropriate models and methods to analyze the data and quantify the risks and uncertainties involved.
- Actuaries should communicate their findings and recommendations in a clear and concise manner to the relevant stakeholders.
- Actuaries should monitor the actual outcomes and compare them with the expected outcomes to assess the performance and validity of their solution.
- Actuaries should review and refine their solution periodically to ensure that it remains relevant and effective in changing circumstances.

The actuarial control cycle can be applied to various domains and contexts, such as insurance, pensions, investments, banking, social security, health care, and public policy. The book provides examples and case studies of how the actuarial control cycle can be used to address different types of problems and challenges in these domains and contexts. The book also discusses the ethical and professional standards that actuaries should follow when performing actuarial management tasks.
